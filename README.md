# üìö Practice-CPP-examples

Welcome to the **Practice-CPP-examples** repository!

This repository is a collection of my hands-on practice projects, algorithms, and concepts implemented in C++. The primary goal is to solidify fundamental C++ language features, data structures, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through consistent practice.

---

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The examples are organized by topic or day, with each specific project residing in its own dedicated folder. This structure makes navigation and understanding the content straightforward

Every example folder is required to include a dedicated **`README.md`** file that explains the **concepts used** and/or the **problem solved** by the code.

## ‚ú® Key Learning Areas Covered

The examples in this repository focus on key areas of modern C++ programming:

| Category | Topics Covered | Example Folders (Illustrative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism. | `bank.cpp` |
| **Data Structures** | Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Maps. | `array.cpp` |
| **C++ Fundamentals** | Pointers, References, Memory Management, Input/Output, Error Handling. | *Upcoming* |
| **Algorithms** | Searching, Sorting, Recursion, and basic algorithmic problem-solving. | *Upcoming* |
| **Standard Template Library (STL)** | Use of `std::vector`, `std::map`, `std::set`, and generic algorithms. | *Upcoming* |
