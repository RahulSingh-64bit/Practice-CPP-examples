# üìö Practice-CPP-examples

Welcome to the **Practice-CPP-examples** repository!

This repository is a collection of my hands-on practice projects, algorithms, and concepts implemented in C++. The primary goal is to solidify fundamental C++ language features, data structures, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through consistent practice.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The examples are organized by topic or day, with each specific project residing in its own dedicated folder. This structure makes navigation and understanding the content straightforward

Every example folder is required to include a dedicated **`README.md`** file that explains the **concepts used** and/or the **problem solved** by the code.

## ‚ú® Key Learning Areas Covered

The examples in this repository focus on key areas of modern C++ programming:

| Category | Topics Covered | Example Folders (Illustrative) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism. | `day1-bank-account`, `dayN-shapes-inheritance` |
| **Data Structures** | Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Maps. | `day2-linked-list`, `dayM-stack-implementation` |
| **C++ Fundamentals** | Pointers, References, Memory Management, Input/Output, Error Handling. | `dayP-smart-pointers` |
| **Algorithms** | Searching, Sorting, Recursion, and basic algorithmic problem-solving. | `dayQ-binary-search` |
| **Standard Template Library (STL)** | Use of `std::vector`, `std::map`, `std::set`, and generic algorithms. | *Upcoming* |

## üöÄ How to Compile and Run an Example

To run any of the C++ examples, you'll need a C++ compiler (like **g++**).

1.  **Navigate** to the specific example folder in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd day1-bank-account
    ```
2.  **Compile** the C++ file (adjust the filenames as needed):
    ```bash
    g++ bank_account.cpp -o bank_app
    ```
3.  **Execute** the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./bank_app
    ```

## ü§ù Contribution

This repository serves as a personal development log. While I welcome any feedback, feel free to open an **Issue** if you spot any bugs or have suggestions for clearer code implementation.
